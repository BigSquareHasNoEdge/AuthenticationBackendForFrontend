# AuthenticationBackendForFrontend

This project is purposed to implement BFF(Backend For Frontend) pattern in terms of authentication based on OAuth 2.0, which is suggested by [IETF draft for OAuth 2.0 for Browswer based apps](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps-19).

## System Layout  

The solution will consist of two application projects:

1. Backend  
Asp.Net Core Minimal Api app. 
3. Frontend  
Blazor Webassembly Standalone app.

Each of them will be hosted in the different domain and Frontend app especially is assumed to be hosted by CDN.

[TBD]
